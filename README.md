# OctoPrint-GPX
An OctoPrint plug-in to use GPX as the protocol layer underneath rather than replacing g-code to talk to s3g/x3g machines, for example, a FlashForge.

This plugin as it is now written requires hooks that are not in OctoPrint as well as changes to GPX to do two way communication.  So if you'd like to try it out, you'll need to use my forks of both.  Not for the faint of heart.  And it's not done yet.  More information coming later.

BTW, I understand foosel not wanting to support MakerBot.  I just got into 3d printing recently and was unaware of the back story before I bought my FlashForge, but now that I have a MakerBot clone, I'd really like it to work with OctoPrint, so hopefully it won't be too much support for MakerBot since it won't possibly work with their newest stuff (Gen 5).
